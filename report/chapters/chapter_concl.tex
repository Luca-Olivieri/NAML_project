In conclusion, our replication has been successful, despite the limits in the availability of the original data and the computational resources constrains. This shows that identification of tumor cells using machine learning with good accuracy is possible. Looking ahead, continued improvements in machine learning and data collection show great potential for enhancing accuracy in tumor classification.
